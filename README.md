An analysis of accelerometer data generated from an experiment with Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.

### Contents

  - `CodeBook.md` - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to summarize the data.
  - `run_analysis.R` - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.
  - `run_data_summary.txt` - Output file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
  - `README.md` - This file.

### Getting started

  1. Read through the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script to get a general understanding of this project, the steps taken in the analysis, and the output file.
  2. Make sure the [experiment data](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata/projectfiles/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is downloaded and extracted to a folder in the project directory called `UCI HAR Dataset`,set afterwards as working directory in R when running the script.
  3. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.
